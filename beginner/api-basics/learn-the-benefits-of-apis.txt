Learn the Benefits of APIs

Benefits of using APIs :
Outsourcing : 
APIs allow you to outsource key data and functionality through a predictable standard interface.
Increased mobility : 
Even if the pattern of the interface changes, consuming devices can be easily adapted as the standards are well-defined and documented.
Abstraction : 
Your software just needs to know how to connect to the other system, not how the other system works.
Increased developer productivity : 
APIs are designed to take an existing code base and use it whenever, wherever instead of attempting to re-create those features.

Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) :
When applications connect to APIs from across the Internet, the majority of API providers make the connections over HTTP, otherwise known as the World Wide Web.

HTTP verbs :
POST : Submit requested data to a server for processing.
GET : Retrieve requested data from a server.
PUT : Update and replace existing data with new data being sent in the request.
DELETE : Remove the requested data from the server.

Mashups :
When an application makes calls to multiple APIs and API providers at the same time.
