Make APIs for You and Me

Application Programming Interface (API) :
An API is equivalent to a user interface, except itâ€™s designed for software instead of humans.
The client sends a request for specific information or functionality to another system.  
That system returns the data or functionality in a response.
To send or receive data, there is an expectation that it will be in a specific format that both sides can understand.
